# Development

In this chapter we will create and dockerize a fresh Rails 5 application.
We are going to use production-ready images so we can test the production setup locally
before run it in production. That's one of the best advantages of using Docker.
We can simulate a similar production environment and that way make sure
that all is going to work as a long as we use the same images and
versions for the software.

The application that we are going to build will be just a regular Rails application
with some scaffolds. This application will be connected to a Database and a Search
Engine which in this case are going to be Postgres and Elasticsearch. We are not
adding to much complexity to the application logic because is not as relevant as the
setup for connecting all of the different elements in the architecture and the 
deployment workflow. This workflow will go from pushing new features to DockerHub
to deploying new releases to a staging environment and finally to production.
