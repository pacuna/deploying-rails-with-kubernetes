## Kubernetes

### Basic Concepts

### Installation and creating the cluster

For installing Kubernetes and creating the cluster, we'll be following
the instructions from the [official documentation](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/).
By now you should have the AWS CLI installed and your AWS account properly
configured.
Let's add some environmental variables to our rc profile (.zshrc or .bashrc depending
on what shell you're using):

    export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws
    export KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-2a
    export NUM_NODES=4
    export MASTER_SIZE=t2.small
    export NODE_SIZE=t2.small
    export AWS_S3_REGION=us-west-2a
    export INSTANCE_PREFIX=k8s

Here we are setting the cluster configuration, which for now will have
4 machines of site t2.small in the us-west-2a region.
Now run a `source` command against the file so the variables are exported 
for the current sessions.

    $ source FILE

We can run one command that will install Kubernetes and will create the cluster for us.

    cd ~
    export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws; curl -sS https://get.k8s.io | bash
