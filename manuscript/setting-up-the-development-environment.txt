## Setting up the Development Environment

The only requirements for this part of the book, are Ruby/Rails and Docker.
We need Ruby and Rails for creating a new application and Docker for running 
the application.

### Ruby/Rails installation

If you don't have a recent version of any of these, I recommend you to use
some Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
Any of those should work for the Ruby version we need, which in this case
is `2.3.0dev`. Although any version equal or higher than `2.2.2` should work.

We also need Rails installed in our system so we can create a fresh application.
A couple of days ago the first Rails 5 rc version was released, so I'll be using
that one. After setting up your Ruby version, you can use the `gem install`
command and install the most recent version for Rails 5. For example in my case
I used:

    gem install rails --version 5.0.0.rc1 --no-ri --no-rdoc

in order to get the current latest version.

### Installing Docker

Today we have several options for running Docker. If you're on OS X you can use
[Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), [Docker for Mac](https://beta.docker.com/)
which is only available through invitation at the moment but maybe you're reading this
when it's already out. You can also run a Linux Virtual Machine and
run native Docker. For windows you have the same options and for Linux
you can enjoy the best experience with native Docker without any sort of virtualization.
Any of these should work, just check that you're using the latest version
for Docker and for Docker Compose. In my case I'm running `Docker version 1.11.1, build 5604cbe`
and `docker-compose version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35`. That's really important
since some of the features like networking are only available in the recent versions.
