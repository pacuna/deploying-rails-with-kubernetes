### Creating a new Rails App

I have the latest Rails version (Rails 5.0.0.rc1) and Ruby 2.3.0dev version.
Let's create a new Rails application:

    $ rails new myapp
 
We are not using any options by now. We'll be adding more features and dependencies progressively.

If you run `rails s` you should be able to see the application running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
