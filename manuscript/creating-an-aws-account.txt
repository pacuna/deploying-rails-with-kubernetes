## Creating an AWS Account

By now you should have a DockerHub account ready for pushing and pulling images.
The other requirement for this book, is to have an AWS account.
Right now the two best integrations for Kubernetes are AWS and Google Compute Engine.
We will focus on AWS since I believe is a more mature Cloud provider at the moment.

If you don't have an AWS account already, go to the [official website](https://aws.amazon.com/)
and create one. As a warning, in this tutorial we'll be using resources not
covered by the [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) mainly because
a Rails application needs a bit more amount of computer resources
than the minimal offered by AWS. We're also going to need access to the Load Balancer
and S3 resources. But don't worry, after finish the tutorial, you can
drop the entire cluster with just one command and you are only would have to pay
for the time it was up.

The good thing about the Kubernetes integration with these services (AWS and GCE)
is that you don't even have to use their panels for the resources. This is because
the Kubernetes command for creating the cluster will create all the necessary resources for us.
We only have to configure the initial size of the cluster, the region and the type
of instances we want to create.
