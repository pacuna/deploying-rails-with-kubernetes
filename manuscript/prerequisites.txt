## Prerequisites

I expect you to have a medium knowledge about Docker and its workflow. It's
OK if you have never worked with Docker in a production environment.

Since this is a book about deploying Ruby on Rails, you should also have a medium
to advanced Rails knowledge. I won't explain basic things about Ruby or Rails.

We are going to work with Postgres as our Database and Elasticsearch as our search engine.
You don't need previous knowledge about any of these two. The main focus it's going to
be on how to create the connexions between our application and these type components.
