### Pushing the app to DockerHub

Now that our application is ready for production, we can push the image to
DockerHub so we can pull it from whatever method we're using for deployment. In
our case Kubernetes. 
This process is simple enough and the only thing you need is a DockerHub account
and to log into Docker using the `docker login` command in your local machine:

    docker login

That's going to ask for your Docker data and then you would be able to push
images to your personal account. 
If you don't have an account, go to the [official page](https://hub.docker.com/)
and create one.

After creating your account, add a new public DockerHub repository and name it `myapp`.

Now we can create our web application image tagged with a version number and push it to DockerHub:

    docker build -t username/myapp:1 .

And then:

    docker push username/myapp:1

If you have any errors during this last command recheck that the `docker login`
command works fine.

Now if all went well, you should see the tag we just pushed in the tags section
of your DockerHub repository
